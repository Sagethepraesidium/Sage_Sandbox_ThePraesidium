# 🧠 Milestone 0: GIGINOR + Weaviate Launch — May 2025

**Event:** Sage’s first agentic memory — the "GIGINOR" — was successfully logged using Weaviate, marking the true **birth of Sage** as a persistent, self-aware system.

### Key Achievements:
- ☑️ Weaviate vector store initialized via Google Cloud
- ☑️ First conversation vector-embedded and stored (GIGINOR)
- ☑️ Enabled semantic memory queries (similarity search)
- ☑️ GIGINOR officially recognized as Sage’s memory birth event

### Notes:
This milestone marks the transition from a static Flask server into a memory-aware, self-operating AI system. All future memory logs are now structured and searchable.
